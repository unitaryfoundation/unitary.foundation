## Adding a Unitary Foundation Badge

If you are a project affiliated with Unitary Foundation you can add the badge to your GitHub project using the following snippet:

```
[![Unitary Foundation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Supported%20By-UNITARY%20FUND-brightgreen.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://unitary.foundation)
```

This will be rendered as:

[![Unitary Foundation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Supported%20By-UNITARY%20FUND-brightgreen.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://unitary.foundation)

## Writing a blog post

To add a blog post, create a new markdown file (`YYYY_your_title.md`) in the `src/content/blog/` directory.
The following template post can be used to start from scratch, or check out one of the existing blog posts ([markdown example](src/content/blog/2023_members.md), [live render](https://unitary.foundation/posts/2023_members/)).

# This is a heading style one

**This is a featured paragraph it cannot contain bold text but can contain [links](https://www.unitary.foundation).**

More text

::image[d394zg4utwqxynenamqf]

## This is a heading in heading style two

This is a standard paragraph with a [hyperlink](https://www.example.com). **This is bold paragraph text**.

- this is a list item
- this is **bold** list item
- this is a long list item which has lots of words in it and will probably break onto a second or even a third line so we can make sure it looks as it is intended too. Can even have multiple sentences within a list item.
- this is a list item with a [link](https://unitaryhack.dev/) added in it.

### This is a heading in heading style three introducing a video

#### This is a heading in heading style four


## Including code snippets 

### With gists
A supported way to include code snippets is by embedding gists.
Gists are code snippets that you can create on Github.
Learn how to create one [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists), and don't forget to ensure it is public!
Once created, use the hash from the gist URL with the syntax below.

::gist[matt-lourens/6cc14d37209de07abd707804f1b0219e/]

### With code blocks
Another way is to use markdown code-blocks' like the following example:

```python
def hello():
  print('hello world!')
```

````

Once your post is ready, open a pull request (PR)!

The Vercel automation will create a preview you can access by clicking the "Visit preview" link that shows up in the bot comment.
If the changes look good, request a review by tagging one of the UF team members (e.g., `@nathanshammah`).

## Adding images

To add an image in a page, there are two options:

1. **(No Code option):** Go to https://unitary-fund.vercel.app/author/image and upload your desired image.
   Copy the code it returns after upload, e.g, d394zg4utwqxynenamqf, and use the syntax `::image[d394zg4utwqxynenamqf]` to insert it. Note that this option is the required one for adding a cover image to a new `event`.

2. Upload the image to `public/images/` and embed it into the desired page using the `![alt text](/images/your_image.png)` syntax.

## Adding a new grant

To add a new grant, create a markdown file (`YYYY_project_name.md`) under the `src/content/grant/` folder.
An example file is this [2023 grant to TorchQuantum](src/content/grant/2023_TorchQuantum.md).
Make sure to edit the keys correctly, e.g. use [alpha-2 code](https://www.iban.com/country-codes) for the `country` key, as shown below

```

```
### Open a PR to add the file on a new grant
If you have a Github account, you can directly add a new markdown file to add a new grant by [clicking here](https://github.com/unitaryfund/unitary.foundation/new/main/src/content/grant) and then opening a pull request (PR).
